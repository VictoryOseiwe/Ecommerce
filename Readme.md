# Foot Store

The Foot Store is a comprehensive ecommerce application built on Node.js and Express.js, leveraging MongoDB for database management and EJS as the view engine. Following the MVC architecture, it offers robust functionality for both administrators and users. Administrators can securely sign in, manage users (including blocking/unblocking), oversee categories, and handle products with features like image cropping and resizing. Meanwhile, users can enjoy a seamless experience, signing up or logging in with validation, OTP functionality, or single sign-on options like Google or Facebook. The user side boasts a user-friendly interface with product listings, detailed views complete with image zoom, essential product information including ratings, prices, discounts, and stock availability. Error handling ensures a smooth user experience, while related product recommendations enhance engagement.
